## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism refers to the ability of OOP language to differntiate between entities with same name. This can be achieved by signature and declaration of these entities.
  - In Java, polymorphism can be achieved using method overloading and method overriding.
  - In JavaScript, polymorphism can be achieved using method overriding. JavaScript supports overriding not overloading, meaning, that      if you define two functions with the same name, the last one defined will override the previously defined version and every time      a call will be made to the function, the last defined one will get executed.
